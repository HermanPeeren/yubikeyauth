PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_YUBIKEYTOTP="Two Factor Authentication - YubiKey + Google Authenticator"
PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_YUBIKEYTOTP_XML_DESCRIPTION="Allows users on your site to use two factor authentication using a YubiKey secure hardware token or, if they don't have access to it, an ever-changing six digit code generated by Google Authenticator or a compatible application. Users need their own Yubikey available from http://www.yubico.com/ and/or Google Authenticator or a compatible application (e.g. Authy). To use two factor authentication users have to edit their user profile and enable two factor authentication."

PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_YUBIKEYTOTP_ERR_VALIDATIONFAILED="You did not enter a valid YubiKey secret code or the YubiCloud servers are unreachable at this time."
PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_YUBIKEYTOTP_INTRO="This feature allows you to use a YubiKey secure hardware token for two factor authentication. On top of your username and password you will also need to insert your YubiKey in your computer's USB port, click inside the Secret Key area of the site's login area and touch YubiKey's gold disk. The secret code generated by your YubiKey is unique to your device and changes constantly. This provides extra protection against hackers logging in to your account even if they were able to get hold of your password. You can link one or more YubiKey secure hardware tokens to your user account. You can use any one of them when logging in.<br/>Moreover, you can set up Google Authenticator (or a compatible application) as a backup authentication method. If you don't have access to your YubiKey or are using a device which does not support YubiKey authentication (mobile phone, a terminal with blocked USB ports etc) you will be able to use the ever-changing six-digit code generated by Google Authenticator or a compatible application to log in to the site."
