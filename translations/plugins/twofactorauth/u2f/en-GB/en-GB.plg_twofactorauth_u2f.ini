PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_U2F_INTRO="This feature allows you to use a compatible FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) secure hardware token for two factor authentication, e.g. a YubiKey U2F, YubiKey Neo, Plug-up FIDO U2F key etc. On top of your username and password you will also need to insert your U2F Key in your computer's USB port (and touch is blinking button if there is one). The process performed between your browser and the hardware token uses very strong cryptography, making it practically impossible to forge. This provides extra protection against hackers logging in to your account even if they were able to get hold of your password. You can link one or more U2F secure hardware tokens to your user account. You can use any one of them when logging in."
