PLG_TWOFACTORAUTH_YUBIKEYPLUS_INTRO="This feature allows you to use a YubiKey secure hardware token for two factor authentication. On top of your username and password you will also need to insert your YubiKey in your computer's USB port, click inside the Secret Key area of the site's login area and touch YubiKey's gold disk. The secret code generated by your YubiKey is unique to your device and changes constantly. This provides extra protection against hackers logging in to your account even if they were able to get hold of your password. You can link one or more YubiKey secure hardware tokens to your user account. You can use any one of them when logging in."
